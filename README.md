## William's Car Game üèéÔ∏è

Welcome to William's Car Game!  Dodge the enemy car and level up in this classic arcade-style game. Perfect for a quick break.


## Game Overview

In this Car Game, you control a yellow car that needs to avoid colliding with an enemy white car moving along the road. The road has two lanes, and you can switch between them using the 'A' or left arrow key and the 'D' or right arrow key. The game starts at level 1, with a relatively slow speed for the enemy car. As you progress, the speed of the enemy car increases, making the game more challenging. The game displays the current level at the top right corner of the screen, and it allows you to restart or quit the game after losing.
